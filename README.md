# Social Media Contact Page

## Description

Social media is very important these days. They have become a way to reach out to people. For this project, I decided to build the page mainly in JavaScript. All of the content that is being shown in the application is created using JavaScript. I did not use a css file to style the page. All of the styling was done in JavaScript.

By doing this project, I learned that it is possible to create a website using only JavaScript. The layout of the page is a card which contains a person's contact information as well as the name and profession.
